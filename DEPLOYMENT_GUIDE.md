# Deployment Guide

Your code is now on GitHub! ðŸŽ‰

Repository: https://github.com/writingsbyali-hub/xbyali

## Step 1: Enable GitHub Pages

1. Go to your repo: https://github.com/writingsbyali-hub/xbyali
2. Click **Settings** (top right)
3. In the left sidebar, click **Pages**
4. Under "Build and deployment":
   - Source: Select **GitHub Actions**
5. The first deployment should start automatically
6. Wait 2-3 minutes for the build to complete
7. Your site will be live at: `https://writingsbyali-hub.github.io/xbyali/`

## Step 2: Set Up Custom Domain (xbyali.page)

### A. In GitHub Settings:

1. Still in **Settings** â†’ **Pages**
2. Under "Custom domain", enter: `xbyali.page`
3. Click **Save**
4. Check the box for "Enforce HTTPS" (might need to wait a bit first)

### B. Configure DNS at Your Domain Registrar:

You need to add DNS records where you bought `xbyali.page` (e.g., Namecheap, Porkbun, etc.)

**Add these 4 A records:**
```
Type: A
Name: @ (or leave blank)
Value: 185.199.108.153

Type: A
Name: @
Value: 185.199.109.153

Type: A
Name: @
Value: 185.199.110.153

Type: A
Name: @
Value: 185.199.111.153
```

**Add a CNAME record for www:**
```
Type: CNAME
Name: www
Value: writingsbyali-hub.github.io
```

### C. Wait for DNS Propagation

- DNS changes take 5 minutes to 48 hours (usually ~1 hour)
- Check status: https://www.whatsmydns.net/#A/xbyali.page
- Once propagated, your site will be live at `https://xbyali.page`

## Step 3: Verify Everything Works

Visit:
- âœ“ `https://xbyali.page` - Your landing page
- âœ“ `https://xbyali.page/library` - Your library
- âœ“ `https://xbyali.page/about` - About page

## Troubleshooting

**Site not deploying?**

- Make sure you selected "GitHub Actions" as the source in Pages settings

**Custom domain not working?**
