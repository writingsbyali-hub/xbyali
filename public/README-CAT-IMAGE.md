# Add Your Cat Image

To complete the landing page, add your cat image to this folder:

1. Save the cat photo as: `cat-hero.jpg`
2. Place it in the `public` folder (this folder)
3. The landing page will automatically display it

The image should be the one you shared - the cat lying in the sunlight on the pavement.

The landing page is set up to display it with:
- Soft opacity (40% in light mode, 30% in dark mode)
- Gentle floating animation
- Behind the text content
- Responsive sizing

If you want to use a different filename, update line 17 in `src/pages/index.astro`:
```
src="/cat-hero.jpg"
```
